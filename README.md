This is a simple beginner website made in a few days using react, vite, and two public free use APIs. One API provides information based off your zip code,
while the other provides sunset and sunrise information. For now the return is only in UTC, and doesn't directly match the current timezone for where you put 
the zip code in.


The website is accessible at: sunsetsunrisezip.netlify.app
